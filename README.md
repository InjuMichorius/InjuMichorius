## <center>Hey, I'm Inju Michorius 👋</center>
I want to work as a front-end developer with UI/UX design skills.

Hello, my name is Inju Michorius and I'm a third year Communication and Multimedia Design student.

I'm always trying to become the best version of myself. I love to play guitar, drink a cold one with the boys and play videogames.

### What I'm focusing on
Currently trying to get a portfolio website online

I'm also following a minor Web Development where I learn to master HTML, CSS and Javascript.
